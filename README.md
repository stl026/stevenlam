# :octocat: Who am I? :octocat:

Hello, I'm Steven Lam.

I am a Full-Stack Engineer working primarily with MERN/PERN stack applications. 

Previously, I was a Human Biology major teaching students at a high school camp at UCSD. I took the leap during covid to explore software engineering, and I love pretty much everything about it - even the bugs! :shushing_face:


### Recent applications I have been working on:
---

[Healthy Food, Inc.](https://github.com/HealthyBilly/BillyHealthy)
- A portal connecting busy families/users with their local farmers whilst providing a variety of options such as meal plans or an online local marketplace.

[Kitty Nugs](https://github.com/KFCNuggets/project-catwalk)
- An eCommerce product discovery retail web application for online shoppers.

[TapThat](https://github.com/stl026/tapthat)
- React-native application using Expo logging and presenting the user with data about their ability ot maintain a consistent tempo.
